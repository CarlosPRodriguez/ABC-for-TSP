# ABC-for-TSP
A simple Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem written in Python. 

This implementation explores how different hive dynamics affect the quality of solution to TSP. It is designed to run ABC multiple times on the same input to capture accuracy metrics.
